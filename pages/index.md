Deadlines are real, and getting things done is the goal, but rushing to go faster, ironically, ends up making us go slower, with more bugs, and the difficulty of finding a needle in a haystack. So getting work done ends up taking longer than if we wrote clean code to begin with.

The only way to make the deadline—the only way to go fast—is to keep the code as clean as possible at all times.

Because we spend the majority of our time reading code, ours and others, it is mandatory to set guidelines for how it should be written and managed, following is a list of style guides to help you craft readable, maintainable and solid code, that will read like written prose and help your colleges and yourself staying productive throughout your journey of creating world class software.

{% quote owner="Robert Martin" %}
The ratio of time spent reading vs. writing is well over 10:1.

So, with the principle of writing clean code, to serve the higher purpose of increasing developer productivity throughout code readability, consistency and reusability, in mind. Let’s dig in.
