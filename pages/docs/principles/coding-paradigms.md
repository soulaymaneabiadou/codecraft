Within a codebase, it is advisable to stick with one paradigm, this is not a hard requirement, but it will simplify many aspects. Functional programming is recommended for most cases.

Another suggestion is to adopt the **structured programming** paradigm, which is aimed at improving the clarity, quality, and development time by making extensive use of the structured control flow constructs of selection (if/then/else) and repetition (while and for), block structures, and subroutines.
