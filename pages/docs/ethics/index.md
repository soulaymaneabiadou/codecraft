Because the default in the world, in anything is chaos and to insure order, we must have rules, ethics and principles. We present the oath.

These ethics have been taken strait, as is from the programmerâ€™s oath coined by Robert Martin in the Clean coder blog: [TheProgrammersOath](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2015/11/18/TheProgrammersOath.html)

### The Programmer's Oath

_18 November 2015_

In order to defend and preserve the honor of the profession of computer programmers,

**I Promise that, to the best of my ability and judgement:**

1. I will not produce harmful code.
2. The code that I produce will always be my best work. I will not knowingly allow code that is defective either in behavior or structure to accumulate.
3. I will produce, with each release, a quick, sure, and repeatable proof that every element of the code works as it should.
4. I will make frequent, small, releases so that I do not impede the progress of others.
5. I will fearlessly and relentlessly improve my creations at every opportunity. I will never degrade them.
6. I will do all that I can to keep the productivity of myself, and others, as high as possible. I will do nothing that decreases that productivity.
7. I will continuously ensure that others can cover for me, and that I can cover for them.
8. I will produce estimates that are honest both in magnitude and precision. I will not make promises without certainty.
9. I will never stop learning and improving my craft.

### Other unwritten rules

- You're responsible for code quality, use meaningful names and write code that expresses intent.
- Code should speak for itself. Less comments = less maintenance. **Comments are often lies waiting to happen**.
- The boy scout rule: Leave the code better than you found it.
- Single-responsibility code, i.e A function does only 1 thing well. Less arguments = better function. cohesiveness; most methods use most of the class properties.
- Write and test every line of code (TDD); integration and unit tests
- Work on big picture skeleton, then fill in the details later; interface first, implementation later.
- Always aim to create independent components that can be used in different places.
- Never allow bad code to stay.
- Master your craft.
