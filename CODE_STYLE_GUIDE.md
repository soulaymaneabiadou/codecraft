# CodeCraft - Our Code Style Guide

Welcome to CodeCraft's Code Style Guide. This guide provides the conventions and best practices for writing clean, readable, and maintainable code and docs across our projects.

TLDR; use proper formatting and style to make the code easily readable and modular.

## Formatting

### Indentation

- Use 2 spaces for indentation.
- Do not use tabs for indentation.

### Spacing

- Use a space after commas, colons, and semicolons.
- Use a space before and after binary operators (e.g., `a + b`).

### Line Length

- Limit lines to a maximum of 80 characters for better readability, this applies to code mainly.

## Naming Conventions

### Variables

- Use camelCase for variable names (e.g., `myVariable`).
- Use meaningful and descriptive names that convey the purpose of the variable.

### Functions

- Use camelCase for function names (e.g., `calculateTotal`).
- Use verbs or verb phrases for function names to describe their actions.

## Comments

- Write comments to explain complex logic or unclear code, when the room for making it simpler ceases to exist of course.
- Comments should be clear, concise, and focused on why, not what.

## Best Practices

### Error Handling

- Always handle errors gracefully to prevent application crashes.
- Use meaningful error messages to aid in debugging.

### Modularity

- Keep code modular, organized, and divided into logical components.
- Aim for single-responsibility functions.
