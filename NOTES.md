# Introduction

Why: writing great documentation can help your team wramp up, can help users adopt your product, decrease support burden

# Process

Start with why we write the docs, what the reader needs, how to document the piece of tech they will use to help them use it effectivey or information

Only include what is relevant

Write less, only what is needed, well structured and up to date

Write the outline first: answer: who is this for, what are they trying to get done

To avoid getting blocked, speak out loud(rubber duck debugging)

Write readably, with structure, headings, bullet points, lists(steps for processes to follow), keep one idea per paragraph, and 25words per sentence, put the post important parts first, be direct with your writing

it is not about docs, it is about helping people get stuff done, if the ducmented topic is complicated, it is a sign that that thing needs to be fixed to simplify the docs

Use diagrams, examples and graphics when it makes sense, to explain complex topics

show/illustrate how the result should be after a guided walkthrough
